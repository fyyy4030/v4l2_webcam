Webcam Streaming with V4L2 and SDL

This code basically handles a webcam, activates the stream mode and
renders it on a SDL Window.

Most part of the code was based on some other implementations like:
https://github.com/kryali/SmileTime/blob/master/SDL-capture-example.cpp
http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/devices/projects/pendawchi/src/capture.c
https://jwhsmith.net/2014/12/capturing-a-webcam-stream-using-v4l2/

In these cases, the developer converted YUYV (grabbed from webcam) to RGB, to be able to draw it
in an SDL_Surface. So, I didn't wanted to learn such algorithm, I used SDL_Overlay, which
is a "window" created over an SDL_Surface, but with the advantage of using YUYV
directly, without converting formats.

Notes:
* pixel format is fixed in YUYV, because my webcam just have this format. Better webcams support
	other formats.
* It's a very basic support, just an example of how to do it
